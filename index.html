    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p> Thank you for visiting my Resume webpage. I am currently studying Computer Science at Los Angeles Pierce College, as an aspiring full-stack and applications developer. My previous studies were in CSU Northridge, where I graduated with a major of Health Administration. </p>
    <p> I have spent the last 3-4 years working for small healthcare companies. While working at these companies, I saw that much of the software used to handle medical records and billing were severely outdated. These companies didn't have the extra capital to invest in a cutting-edge medical records software, or were simply intimidated by the use of new applications </p>
    <p>I plan to create healthcare software that will greatly increase the effectiveness and efficiency of smaller companies, with little to no cost/overhead, and an easy to operate interface that anybody can follow. Hopefully this gives them an edge against larger companies. </p>
